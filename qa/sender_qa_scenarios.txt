what to check:
validate request
payload sent to SQS
async call after time passed
process one day
process range of dates with data in all existing dates
process range where some dates dont not exist
stop flow execution
check if proceed processing works after stop flag
verify metrics logged okey with correct date time and millis
verify to send keys without .json
